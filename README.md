#  :magic_wand: Wands of Triskaideka :magic_wand:
_An entry for 2024 js13k game jam. Theme is Triskaidekaphobia_

:magic_wand: :blush:

Once upon a time, there is a wizard, Trika, who is a freshman in the Deka Academy.

He does not perform well in his class and all his classmates, even his teachers, are all teasing him about how bad and unfit he is.

One day, he wandered into the Lost Woods and found a mysterious wand.

He picked that up, wishing to find its original owner. 

However unfortune starts to befall him.....

### The beginning
Triskaidekaphobia... How many letters are there ? `(17)`

When the theme pops up, there are several ideas that come to my head.
- 2d platformer but every 13 steps something potentially dangerous approaches you. However it can help you trigger switches or attack enemies.
- Vampire Surviors but it is Ender who wants to hands everybody swags but all people are too busy with their game hence avoiding him.
- Blackjack but you bust at multiples of 13.
- Uno but you lose if the sum of numbers in the discard pile is multiples of 13 after you played.

There are like several ideas but all of them are my first time to try the genre and they are potentially very hard for me to start. 
The first idea seems pretty easy to implement so I went with this idea instead.
