Once upon a time, there is a wizard, Trika, who is a freshman in the Deka Academy.

He does not perform well in his class and all his classmates, even his teachers, are all teasing him about how bad and unfit he is.

He picked that up, wishing to find its original owner. 

However unfortune starts to befall him.....
